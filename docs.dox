/**
 * @mainpage Event Driven Kernel Documentation
 *
 * @section intro Introduction
 * An event driven kernel is a small, modular, embedded kernel designed for
 * educational and lightweight RTOS applications. It provides:
 * - Event system with publish/subscribe model producing a reactive like firmwares 
 * - POSIX-alike signal handling. The concrete behaviour is a bit differ from POSIX one 
 *      while giving same synchronization context mental model e.g. await/poll for signal flagged paradigm 
 * - Shell command execution framework
 * - Filesystem abstraction and mount management
 * - Kernel logging and journal subsystem
 *
 * @section architecture Kernel Architecture
 * The kernel is organized into modular subsystems:
 * - Kernel Core: Events pipeline (events and service dispatch), publish/subscribe events
 * - Command/Service Registrar: Flexibe command/service registration
 * - Filesystem: Mount, unmount, file operations, and shell commands
 * - Shell: Interactive command-line interface
 * - Signal Handling: Signal masks, delivery, and pending signals (using kernel pipeline)
 * - Journal: Kernel log entries and retrieval
 *
 * @section usage Usage
 * Include public headers from `include/` implement required APIs needed by the kernel using profile (see \ref kernel_needimpl). 
 * At project entry call subsystems initialization you need following with shell start functions to enter into
 * events never ending processing loop.
 * @note some subsystems might not be available according to chosen kernel profile e.g. lite profile doesnt include file I/O subsystem
 *
 * @section license License
 * Event driven kernel is released under the MIT License.

  * @defgroup kernel_needimpl Mandatory APIs called by the Kernel 
  * @brief Kernel can run on any binary system platfrom and compile using target platform toolchain e.g. any gcc variant alike. 
  * There are APIs require implementation within the concrete target platform project. 
  * There are several compile instance profiles available each defines the number of APIs need in implementation

  * - \ref prompt.h  : system prompt constructor called by the kernel shell.
  * - \ref disk.h    : low level Disk I/O operations -> called by kernel file I/O subsystem for raw disk I/O operations or by file system middleware implementation.
  * - \ref fat.h     : file system middleware interface -> called by kernel file I/O subsystem for file I/O operations.
